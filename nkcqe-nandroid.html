                            <p> Hi! I want to do a Nandroid backup of my phone, since I want to test a new rom and NanoDroid (Microg). Would restoring from a Nandroid backup overwrite whatever is installed? Is restoring with Nandroid basically I am trying to create a Nandroid backup via ADB using TWRP 3.2.3-0. My phone (Moto G6) is currently rooted, bootloader unlocked, with TWRP as recovery. I verified that I have the current Google usb drivers installed for ADB Whenever I try to run the ADB command in the console ("adb backup --twrp"), the console will only display the help file for ADB. It doesn't prompt the TWRP interface to begin backup at all. It seems like ADB isn't recognizing the "backup" command. I have verified Does anyone know if its possible to do a nandroid backup of a LOS system directly to a pc without also creating a backup copy on the device? When I try to do this using twrp and adb it always creates a phone copy, which mostly defeats the point of this capability. amp#x200B; I've first tried asking this on r/AndroidQuestions at https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/ak3vrn/using\_twrp\_to\_backup\_to\_pc\_only/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/ak3vrn/using_twr. 
I downloaded tai chi for magisk and I downloaded the apks. I tried opening the app and it would just force close. Now my audio doesn't work at all and videos are laggy. I downloaded malware bites to see if I downloaded a virus and it says I didnt. Sooooo what the fuck did I do? I'm pissed off because NOTHING WITH SOUND WORKS. I'm using a op6 and I have a back up phone but I don't wanna use it. Is there ANYTHING I just need the profile to perform the same tasks, but I want my backups stored on an external SD card and the Retention profile to check the SD card instead of internal storage. The profiles and tasks can be downloaded from this link (http://www.mediafire.com/download/hn3hpc81xb8eu02/NANDroidTasker.zip). Hi! As the title suggests, I've rooted my phone and streamlined it, thus getting to the point that warrants a backup. Ideally I'd like to image my phone so I can restore it if anything goes wrong. My problem is that Samsung phones are automatically encrypted in the set up process and can't seem to find a way round it. If I use TWRP to backup it can't read /data so I can't back it up in recovery. I have read about Online Nandroid Backup and tried it, but it seemed to just run a timer I made a post (https://redd.it/9g8eoq) a few months ago asking how to edit the Tasker Nandroid profile to save to an external sd card. The edits I made to achieve that no longer seem to be working and I can't figure out why. I've tried old versions of Tasker thinking an update broke it, but that didn't work either. Seems odd they would just stop working out of the blue. Is there a new method to do this? Edit: Apparently I just had to manually run a nandroid backup with the SD card selected. so i was having a "bug" where my signal icon appeared as it had no signal (where i knew it had) , i usually restarted my phone to fix it , today i did the same , but when i restarted it the phone and it never tunerned back on , it stayed at the lineage logo loading non stop, i even let it sit for 1.5 hours and nothing,i still can acces to TWRP though im looking for a way to save my device without losing my data :l my device is Samsung galaxy S5 SM-G900M, have latest modem , had the build Hi there, amp#x200B; I hope this is the right place to ask. The title basically says it: I went from Android 8 to 9 and had to do a wipe of my data in the process. I now have a clean install of Android 9 and a Nandroid backup that I did before with TWRP. Can I restore (or more like: how can i restore) my apps/settings etc from the backup but keep the new version? I read somewhere you do that by restoring just the data partition, but when I tried that it left my phone soft bricked I was prompted by Magisk that I needed a newer version to work with the downloaded update that I downloaded for it through the notifications panel. I downloaded the newer version as a zip. I read that is the easiest all inclusive way. Well turns out I needed to go to TWRP to install it so off I went to reboot the phone and go into recovery. When I went into the TWRP menus, it asked for an encryption key. I clicked cancel and it let me back in. I don't have an encryption key. HOWEVER, the intern. Good evening everyone from France! With LOS 15.1 on my OP3T everything was fine with Google Drive :-) When I installed LOS 16 all my data, apps, etc. were reinstalled automatically from Drive. But since I installed LOS 16, Drive "sees" 2 devices: an OP3 AND an OP3T! I only have one OP3T  Now backups of data, apps, etc. on Drive from my OP3T via my Google Account do not seem to be done  One click on "Save Now" gives "Backup impossible" :-( Any idea ? A solution ? Thank you ! Bonsoir. 
So if I move to a custom ROM and lose magisk's safetynet in the process, will the safety net be restored if I restore to the nandroid backup that I've already taken? I'm currently rooted with magisk on stock. I'd like to create a nandroid backup but TWRP isn't recognising my sdcard (decryption issue in this version of TWRP I think.). What can I do? I don't want to format everything as I've just spend ages setting it all up. Is there a way of downgrading TWRP without wiping data or system. My phone is driving me nuts so while I wait for Oreo to drop I want to try a restore to see if it's an app being an ass, but I don't want to end up restoring from a backup. I haven't rooted an Android in like 4 years and I don't want to root this one either so is it possible to get a Nandroid, or any type of image for that matter, without root? I had a GS5 and used TWRP back in the day and feel comfortable using ADB to do whatever I need to do. Thanks. I would like to go back to the latest Oreo build. I have not rooted the phone. I prefer not root the phone. Android Pie is a pile of dung. OMS neutered, other hardware battery issues (( device replacement on its way in a few weeks )). Is there a way to do a nandroid from my mac without rooting ? Can i install a custom recovery from fastboot without losing any data ? Which file specifically ? I created a ADB backup using -f -all -shared -obb -system -apk etc etc but not sure if everything. My current device is a Samsung Galaxy s7 edge 32gb with TWRP, latest version of Magisk, and a custom SuperStock (https://forum.xda-developers.com/s7-edge/development/kernel-superstock-v1-3-5-t3453462) kernel. Recently the display broke after an accident and is barely functional, although it will work sporadically if I keep trying long enough. The phone itself is still otherwise functional and can boot and run normally. Recently I made a nandroid backup through TWRP (system, boot, data partit. Hello, I had my Galaxy S7 crash on my recently (rebooted the phone and was told SystemUI wasn't responding, so the phone stayed at a black screen). Shortly before the crash I did a Nandroid backup of the phone as I was thinking of doing an OS update. That Nandroid backup is stored on my SD card. Anyways, I did a factory reset, and am now trying to restore all my data. I've installed Titanium Backup, and trying to use the 'Restore from Nandroid backup' feature. I've given TiB SD card access. The last few days the unlock process slowly got slower and slower nearing 10 seconds. A restart would fix it for a couple hours at best. Then it started rebooting after the restart so, knowing I had everything backed up with the LG app, I did a full reset. After over 2 hours of restoring I've got nothing. Not a single thing restored. Its factory clean. What a disaster. All tutorials online just tell me to "check whatever partitions I want". But what if don’t know what I want? Boot, System and Data are selected by default. Is that all it takes? There’s a 3GB System Image partition, being so large, do I need to back it up too? Basically what I am looking for is take a “snapshot” of my cellphone and being able to restore it to the way it was when needed. What does everyone choose when doing a Nandroid Backup. </p>
