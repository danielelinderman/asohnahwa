That race is pretty infuriatingly difficult. The second sprint race (Camden amp Route 55) is literally the worst track with a lot of curves and Earl had managed to pick this up as a second one. Is Earl running a Nitrous factory or having a nitrous stock? He buzzed off soon whenever I tried to take the lead at the very starting point of the race.

So I am gonna start right off. This thread was probably so much often in this sub now but I want to give my own opinion We all know how good and almost perfect NFSMW05 was. Especially in this time where EA aka Ghost Games releases not these racing games that we wish. Of course, they can't bring the old characters back, of course, they want their own story and I can understand why Ghost Games want their own story from their mind, BUT you have to look what MW made so good and replayable

Now everyone has their own ideas of things that need to be added, changed or sent straight to the incinerator for the next game, and I think generally there are a few things that people agree on such as performance, car lists, story, multiplayer etc, but I just wanted to give my two cents on stuff that Need For Speed MUST get right for the next game lest they lose even MORE of their fans : Things to change urgently/Improved Performance Upgrade System Payback has the single laziest, most annoyi.

So I was 5 years old when NFS MW came out and it took me a decade from then to finally complete the game. It was mostly because I got stuck on blacklist rivals and more to the point, I was petrified of the cops in that game. The thing that I think I loved most about this game is when I finally did get to a Blacklist Rival, their introduction alone made me feel like everything is on the line and failure is not an option.

On Fifa, the games hardly change year on year, but they sell so much since everyone wants the 'new' players and most of the audience is casual who will just buy it because its the newest fifa.

For Need for Speed: Most Wanted on the PlayStation 2, a GameFAQs Answers question titled "A list of all blacklist members cars?". 1. It's difficult to say about new rims, new spoilers, new bodykit, and other things cause of licenses but i wish FM thinks about them so we can make more combos to enjoy. 1-1.
