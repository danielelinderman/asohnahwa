                            <p> Some shameless self-promotion: https://github.com/TheBenPerson/SBTool. As the title speaks, it was quite an old pc 3d ball game probably made in the early 2000s. As the game went on, you would roll around a ball on different courses, and unlock different balls as you went on. Hell, I'm pretty sure you were able to make your own courses! This was a favourite childhood game of mine, and I'm having lots of trouble finding. It's the 93rd week of spore contests! Rules! ( Last weeks winner, was. /u/Aroxioth, with his Paladin, congrats!. The other mech by /u/Deroni76 was also pretty awesome, and you should definitely check it out on last weeks thread. You know how when the wright brothers built their plane, it had no jet engines, no turbines, but just a bare bones basic flight system? Well, when spore gives you aircraft, you somehow get highly advanced propulsion systems right. 
Can't find switchball anywhere. Important edit: This I played this on a windows PC A game made around the time people used Windows XP, Maybe Windows Vista / 7 exsisted. Maybe made in 2006? Anyway, you move a ball around these obstacles, and you turn into certain materials. Theres Stone, Wood, and Paper. Paper lets you hover when over a fan, I forget the special properties of wood, and Stone is heavy so you can move over a fan without hovering. If you lose control over the ball, like when your by a slope or you just screw. I just got Switchball and it says "Unable to start PhysX! Please run Switchball installer again and choose Repair.", I did that and same error. I have a 3 GB VRAM, my GPU is from 2014 so that shouldn't be a problem Also, I have newest PhysX drivers, so I don't know what's Platform(s): PC Genre: 3rd person platformer? Puzzle? Similar to Marble Blast Ultra. Estimated year of release: 2000-ish. Graphics/art style: Realistic. Notable characters: A ball. Notable gameplay mechanics: You could roll onto specific tiles that would change what the ball was made of. The ball could be made of stone, paper, or wood, and you swapped between these three to solve puzzles. Other details: Was just an all-around good game. Not popular in the slightest, but I loved. Platform(s): Windows Genre: Platformer or Adventure Estimated year of release: 2000-2007 Graphics/art style: I believe it was cell shaded Notable characters: A ball Notable gameplay mechanics: Yellow Top enemy Other details: Not marble blast gold or ultra. 
GIF: https://imgur.com/a/zznLCZi gt Marbles in Space is a relaxing ball rolling puzzle game set in space. gt The ball can change between 3 different materials that are each useful for different reasons. A glass marble, a cork ball and a paper ball. gt It takes inspiration from Ballance, Switchball, Kula World and of course a bit of Marble Madness. If you wish to play it and help out then please join in over on Discord where you can leave feedback, bug reports I remember playing on the 360 a game where the player is a silver ball in the sky. The objective was to roll across a series of objects in order to reach a balloon that would fly you higher to the next level. Edit: It is possible that it was an Xbox Live Arcade game Edit 2: I found it after a bit more research, it’s Switchball, specifically the Sky and Cloud levels. WTF is Marbles in Space?

Primary focus is on PC but there is potential for Linux and Mac too. What game engine are you using?. https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home Actually relatively many titles not available trough established digital distribution channels such as Steam lack articles entirely — for instance Marble Blast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Blast_Gold), Ballance (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballance), Switcball (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchball), Kiss: Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child (https://www.mobygames.com/game/kiss-psycho-circus-the-nightmare-child) and From Dusk Till Dawn (http. It's this old marble game from 2004 I think. I am looking for it for some time but no luck. Same with switchball. Where is a good marble

I really like the genre, probably one of my favorites, but decent games for it are hard to find. Stuff like marble blast, monkey ball, switchball, aerox, overball Im in the mood for a nice ball roller that requires some skill and thinking. Games I already have: The two mentioned above , Edge and Edge Extended , Nintaii, Super monkeyball (altho this one is not quite what I want atm). I also really liked Ballance and Switchball on PC in their respective time frame. It's not Switchball but a similar game where the goal was to get through level as quickly as possible. I remember a level that was shaped like a ski run and not much else. I know its not a lot to go on but thanks 
There's this guy on a forum that's currently trying to find a Marble Game he played in 2008. All he has of it is these ( 5 tracks from the game. It sounds familiar to me but I can't quite put my finger on it. Any help? Games that have been ruled out already: - Marble Blast Gold/Ultra - Rock of Ages - Switchball - Marble Arcadia - Marble Madness - iRoll - Spectraball - Ballance - Neverball There are games that are widely acclaimed and praised by critics. Usually we get such games and really enjoy them; or at least I know I do. But sometimes, it just doesn't work out. No matter how much praise the game gets, and no matter how many times you try to like them, you just can't. They seem to stay on your backlog of games forever. Personally the games that I can't seem to get into are turn based games, games with incredibly steep learning curves, and games </p>
