Hello! To start this off, I am a mid-Diamond Support Main and my second account is a low-Platinum Tank Main. Why am I not a Diamond Main Tank? Well because I am still struggling with Hammond, and I put a lot more time into my Support account. I also spend more time educating myself about Support play. Between Lucio and Ana, I have about 600 hours between them, if you add Mercy and Zen, I have close to 900 hours on Support Heroes alone. Now before you get the "HE'S A SMURF!" pitchforks and torch. I am by no means a blues connoisseur, or an audiophile; however, I have a respecatble collection of albums by many of the big names such as B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson A/N: By popular demand, and because this was too much fun to write, I give you Episode 2. This episode is exclusively from Bradford's perspective, and is shorter than the opening episode, but this feels like a decent stopping point before the next episode. Episode 3 will see the conclusion of this battle, and probably a short jump ahead to our guys regrouping and getting proper introductions, etc. I'm going to be fairly busy for the rest of this week, so while I might surprise you early, don't.

TL;DR: this is a list of things I wish I knew when I started amp#x200B; I'm sure many of the players that are just starting their journey in GW2 already have some experiences in other RPGs, be it table top, MMO or single player. Many of them share some similarities that are usually taken for granted, but here they are thrown out of the window. GW2 is sort of unconventional in how some of its systems work, so I'd like to compile a list of some of the things that may not be the way new players.
